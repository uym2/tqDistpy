# tqDistpy
Python wrapper for tqDist

To start, clone this repo to your machine. The `tqDist` folder contains all the C++ source code to compute triplet and quartet distances of two trees. 
We will use CPython and setuptools to create a Python wrapper. The product is a Python module that has two functions: quartet_distance and triplet_distance
